      <description>This is a short guide on how to set up a private docker registry behind an internal marathon-lb instance all running on DC/OS. Since marathon-lb is a Layer 7 load balancer we will use it to terminate SSL for our private registry and avoid using it in insecure mode. We will use self-signed TLS certificates for that purpose.
Prerequisites  DC/OS cluster (version 1.8+) running on RHEL 7.2 SSH access to all nodes with root privileges.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Julian Neytchev, and I have been making sure to turn it off and on again since 1995.
I spent the first 10 years of my career as a software developer, wrote a lot of code, and filed a lot of TPS reports. I think I still have my red stapler tucked somewhere.
Then one day in 2010 I got a job offer from the consulting arm of Red Hat looking for someone to work on reference architecture design and development for one of their biggest clients.</description>
